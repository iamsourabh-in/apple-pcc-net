Detailed Explanation
Initialization:

The CloudBoardAttestationDaemon initializes by loading configuration, setting up metrics, and initializing the API server and attestation provider.
The CloudBoardJobHelper initializes its API server, attestation client, and job authentication client.
Attestation Process:

The CloudBoardAttestationDaemon starts the attestation server, which interacts with external services for verification.
Metrics are reported to external services.
Job Helper Operations:

The CloudBoardJobHelper starts the cloud app workload and manages requests and responses.
It requests signing keys from the job authentication client and processes requests through the cloud app.
Metrics Management:

Both the daemon and job helper emit and update metrics throughout their operations.
This sequence diagram provides a detailed view of the interactions and processes within the CloudBoardAttestationDaemon and CloudBoardJobHelper classes, highlighting their roles in configuration management, attestation, job handling, and metrics reporting.
