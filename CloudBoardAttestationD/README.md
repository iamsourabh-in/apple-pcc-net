# CloudBoardAttestationD

Sequence diagram that includes all components and interactions, particularly focusing on the CloudBoardAttestationServer and SWTransparencyLog components, we need to consider the interactions as described in the provided code snippets. Here's a comprehensive sequence diagram using PlantUML that captures the flow of operations:

@startuml

actor User as "User/Administrator"
actor ExternalService as "External Services"

participant CloudBoardAttestationServer
participant SWTransparencyLog
participant AttestationProvider
participant Keychain
participant Logger
participant URLSession

User -> CloudBoardAttestationServer: Initialize
CloudBoardAttestationServer -> Logger: Log Initialization
CloudBoardAttestationServer -> AttestationProvider: Create Attested Key
AttestationProvider --> CloudBoardAttestationServer: Return Attested Key

CloudBoardAttestationServer -> SWTransparencyLog: Prove Inclusion of Release
SWTransparencyLog -> URLSession: Send Proof Request
URLSession -> ExternalService: Request Inclusion Proof
ExternalService --> URLSession: Return Proofs
URLSession --> SWTransparencyLog: Return Proofs

SWTransparencyLog --> CloudBoardAttestationServer: Return Transparency Proofs

CloudBoardAttestationServer -> Keychain: Store Key
Keychain --> CloudBoardAttestationServer: Confirmation

CloudBoardAttestationServer -> Logger: Log Attestation Success
Logger --> CloudBoardAttestationServer: Log Entry Created

CloudBoardAttestationServer -> User: Return Attestation Set

Detailed Explanation
Initialization:

The CloudBoardAttestationServer is initialized, logging the event.
Attestation Process:

The CloudBoardAttestationServer requests the creation of an attested key from the AttestationProvider.
The AttestationProvider returns the attested key.
Transparency Proof:

The CloudBoardAttestationServer requests the SWTransparencyLog to prove the inclusion of a release.
The SWTransparencyLog sends a proof request via URLSession to an external service, which returns the proofs.
Key Management:

The CloudBoardAttestationServer stores the key in the Keychain and logs the success.
Response to User:

The CloudBoardAttestationServer returns the attestation set to the user.
This sequence diagram provides a detailed view of the interactions and processes within the CloudBoardAttestationServer and SWTransparencyLog components, highlighting their roles in attestation, transparency proof verification, and key management.
