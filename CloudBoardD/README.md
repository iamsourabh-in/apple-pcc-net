# Cloud Board Daemon Seq Diagram


sequence diagram using PlantUML for the CloudBoardAttestationDaemon.swift class and its interactions, we need to consider the components it interacts with based on the code provided. Here's a breakdown of the components and their interactions:

Components Involved
Actors and External Services:

User/Administrator: Initiates the daemon.
External Services: Includes services for attestation verification and metrics reporting.
Internal Components:

CloudBoardAttestationDaemon: The main actor responsible for managing attestation.
CloudBoardAttestationAPIServerProtocol: Handles API server interactions.
CloudBoardAttestationDConfiguration: Manages configuration settings.
MetricsSystem: Collects and reports metrics.
AttestationProvider: Provides attestation services.
CloudBoardAttestationServer: Runs the attestation server.
Sequence Diagram Flow

participant CloudBoardAttestationDaemon
participant "API Server" as CloudBoardAttestationAPIServerProtocol
participant "Configuration" as CloudBoardAttestationDConfiguration

User -> CloudBoardAttestationDaemon: Start Daemon

CloudBoardAttestationDaemon -> Configuration: Load Configuration
Configuration --> CloudBoardAttestationDaemon: Return Configuration

CloudBoardAttestationDaemon -> MetricsSystem: Initialize Metrics
MetricsSystem --> CloudBoardAttestationDaemon: Metrics Initialized

CloudBoardAttestationDaemon -> CloudBoardAttestationAPIServerProtocol: Initialize API Server
CloudBoardAttestationAPIServerProtocol --> CloudBoardAttestationDaemon: API Server Ready

CloudBoardAttestationDaemon -> AttestationProvider: Initialize Attestation Provider
AttestationProvider --> CloudBoardAttestationDaemon: Attestation Provider Ready

CloudBoardAttestationDaemon -> CloudBoardAttestationServer: Start Attestation Server
CloudBoardAttestationServer -> ExternalService: Request Attestation Verification
ExternalService --> CloudBoardAttestationServer: Attestation Results
CloudBoardAttestationServer --> CloudBoardAttestationDaemon: Attestation Server Running

CloudBoardAttestationDaemon -> MetricsSystem: Report Metrics
MetricsSystem -> ExternalService: Send Metrics Data

Detailed Explanation
Initialization: The CloudBoardAttestationDaemon initializes by loading the configuration, setting up metrics, and initializing the API server and attestation provider.
Configuration Management: The configuration is loaded from a file or preferences, and validated to ensure it meets the required criteria.
Metrics and API Server: The metrics system is initialized to collect and report metrics, while the API server is set up to handle incoming requests.
Attestation Provider: The attestation provider is initialized to manage the attestation process, which may involve using in-memory keys or cloud-based attestation.
Attestation Server: The attestation server is started, which interacts with external services to verify attestation and report results back to the daemon.
Metrics Reporting: The metrics system periodically reports metrics data to external services for monitoring and analysis.
This PlantUML script provides a visual representation of the interactions between the components of the CloudBoardAttestationDaemon, highlighting how it manages configuration, attestation, and metrics reporting.
